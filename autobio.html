                I was born on a warm day on July 31, 2002. My mother gave birth to me at exactly 5:30 pm at Bucag Hospital, Cauayan City, Isabela. 
                I was the firstborn of my parents. My mother had me when she was 29 years old, and my father had me when he was 30 years old. My name 
                is derived from a book author and her character in the book Gracielle Anne and my aunt Joyce. The house that we are living in is owned 
                by my grandparents at 01, Purok 6 Labinab, Cauayan City, Isabela.

                My mother is a teacher far from our city, her name is Jhona M. Jacinto, while my father is a farmer, his name is Severino A. Jacinto, 
                they don’t have time to take care of me. So when I was 8 months old, they decided to bring me to my mother's house, where her mother 
                and siblings lived at Calinoan Centro, Sto. Tomas, Isabela. I lived there until I was 2 years old. My first birthday and my baptism coincided. 
                I was baptized at the Calinaoan Church of Christ. I saw in a few photographs and memories from that period of time that they celebrated my 
                birthday in a simple way. I believe I grew up in a typical neighbourhood among people who didn't have much money but had a well-defined culture 
                centered on family, work, and church.

                They decided to bring me back home soon after my mother began teaching in a school in our city. I started studying at school at the age of five. 
                I graduated from kindergarten at The Cauayan Messiah Christian School in 2008, and the same year, my mother gave birth to my brother. I was so 
                happy that he came into our lives because I had a playmate. I’m the one who gave him his name. I derived his name after an actor named Jericho 
                Rosales, and I added King. His name is King Jericho.
