                At the age of 12 during my elementary year, I was hospitalized because when I had diarrhea it contained white blood. When they took me to the 
                hospital, they found out that I had high blood pressure. During that time, I only ate boiled egg whites. During my elementary year I joined a 
                lot of competitions like street dancing, cooking competitions, and extracurricular activities. I graduated from elementary school at San Fermin 
                Elementary School in 2014.

                My mother enrolled me in high school where she graduated at Northern Isabela Academy Inc. It's OK with me because my childhood best friend will 
                be my schoolmate. I cried every night then because I missed them, but it didn't take long for me to adjust. I also make a lot of friends. I 
                really enjoy living and studying there. I've experienced being scolded because I didn't come home at the right time, I was also scolded because 
                I got into a fight on the side of the road because my opponent misunderstood me. I also experienced having my first crush, first boyfriend and 
                first heartbreak. During my school year I participated in a lot of activities, I joined a school officer organization for 3 years, I became a 
                classroom officer for 2 years, for almost 13 years that our school didn’t have a school prom. I was crowded  as a valentine queen when our school 
                had a prom again. That is one of the unforgettable moments in my life because of that I become the talk of the town. They can’t believe that a 
                fat girl became a valentine queen. In 2018, when I meet my current boyfriend I was happy because my family and relatives accepted him with all 
                their hearts.  But despite the fun you felt and experienced, there was sadness in exchange. The year 2019, my grandmother had a stroke, and this 
                was my last year as a high school student. My aunt and I took her to a nearby hospital, and the doctor said that we needed to transfer our 
                grandmother to another hospital because he needed to do a CT scan test. I didn't know what to do at that time. My aunt, who was with me, also 
                didn't know what we were going to do. I was talking to the doctor. I was calling my parents, who were here in Cauayan. We were called to the 
                nearby hospital a lot back then because their CT scan was not available, and by the grace of God, the last hospital that we called had an 
                available CT scan. My mother's cousin went with me to transfer her to another hospital. That was my first, and hopefully last, ride in an 
                ambulance. Every time I saw an ambulance, I remembered that time, and I suddenly burst into tears. I graduated high school at Northern Isabela 
                Academy Inc. Year 2020.

                And now I’m a college student at Isabela State University taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. This course is not my first 
                choice. My first choice was education, but sadly I didn’t pass the entrance exam. I was disappointed with myself. It took me two weeks to accept 
                the outcome. I cried every night, but thanks to my cousin, who helped me forget what happened. When the day came that we needed to choose which 
                course we would take, I saw the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology course. I got curious about this course, so I took a Bachelor of 
                Science in Information Technology as my course. During my first years in college, I thought this course was easy, but I was wrong. In my second 
                year, I got a low grade. I didn’t expect that because I knew I put a lot of effort into that subject. I cried every night. My lover and cousin 
                motivated me to think that it's OK to have a low grade. At the very least, I did not fail. After our summer class, I'm an incoming third year, 
                and I'm hoping that God will guide me until I finish college.
